# Scheduled Item Publishing in Modern SharePoint Site Pages

For those of us used to the rich content publishing features in the old "Classic" SharePoint Publishing model, the new Modern experience takes a little getting used to. For example, until very recently there wasn't much at all in the way of content approval to say nothing of the more advanced featured like scheduled item publishing.  This month (August 2018) Microsoft [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint/Announcing-SharePoint-page-approvals/td-p/215466) a new solution for page approvals utilizing Flow under the covers, which promises to enable the sort of funcitonality we were used to in Classic publishing sites.

One of the Classic features my client use all the time is scheduled item publishing. In Classic Publishing libraries, this was a setting on the library that allowed content approvers to set a date and time when the page would be published, and it worked pretty well. This feature is missing on Modern, but with the new Flow capability, we can bring it back.
